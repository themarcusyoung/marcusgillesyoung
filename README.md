Hi, i'm Marcus, a Software Engineer based in San Francisco working at [Verusen](https://verusen.com). I've been programming since 2013, and graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from the George Washington University in 2021. I've been working professionally for two years, and absolutely love the industry. I'm always excited to learn new frameworks, languages and tools.
